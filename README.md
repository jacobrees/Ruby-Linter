```
$ cd <folder>
```

```
$ git clone git@github.com:jacobrees/Ruby-Linter.git
```

To launch DragonLintAlpha inside of your terminal you will need to navigate into the repository you have just cloned. You will do this by using `cd` inside of your terminal. Once you are inside of this folder run the command `bin/main.rb` and this will launch the program. 

Below shows the following commands you will need to run to achieve this:

```
$ cd Ruby-Linter
```

```
$ bin/main.rb
```

#### Rspec Testing (optional)

To test the code, run `rspec --format doc` from root of the folder using terminal.
> Rspec is used for the test.

To install Rspec if you do not already have Rspec installed run the bash command bellow

# The Operations of This Linter

## 1. Layout

### Checks For Trailing Spaces

- Detects unnecessary spaces at the end of a line

#### good

```
  def example|
    puts 'example'|
  end|
```

#### bad

```
  def example |
    puts 'example' |
  end |
```


### Checks For Multiple Empty Lines

- Checks if there is more than one blank line in after the other.

#### good

```
  class Example
    def initialize(name)
      @name = name
    end
  end

   def example
    puts 'example'
  end
```

#### bad

```
  class Example
    def initialize(name)
      @name = name
    end
  end


  def example
    puts 'example'
  end
```

## 2. Naming

### Checks Variable Name

- Detects if variables are using proper snake_case for their names.

#### good

```
example_var = 0
```

#### bad

```
exampleVar = 0
```

### Checks Method Name

- Detects if methods are using proper snake_case for their names.

#### good

```

  # code
end
```

```

### Checks Class Name

- Detects if classes are using proper PascalCase for their names.

#### good
